# Logistic-Regression-Model
Implemented a logicstic regression model in python and tested it on two problems.

1) Predict whether a student will be able to get admit from xyz university based on his/her scores in two tests.
2) Predict whether a microchip passes quality assurance test based on the results of two different tests performed on those chips.

As feature set is small, the model does feature mapping by taking all polynomial terms of two features up to power of six to form a more comprehensive feature set. The program also visualizes data-set and  plots the learned function against data-set values.
